# Raspberry Pi Motion Detection.

#### What you'll need.

[Passive Infrared Motion Sensor](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B008AESDSY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B008AESDSY&linkCode=as2&tag=jasonbelljava-21) (You only need the one but I order five at a time)

[Solderless Breadboard](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0040Z1ERO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B0040Z1ERO&linkCode=as2&tag=jasonbelljava-21)

And you'll also need some wires to connect it all together. To see what goes where have a look at my blog post [Raspberry Pi PIR Motion Detection](http://dataissexy.wordpress.com/2013/06/29/raspberry-pi-pir-motion-detection-and-alerting-to-sms-raspberrypi-sms-sensors/)

##motion2sms.py

This Python script detects motion from the PIR and sends an SMS text message via the TextLocal service (in the UK) using their HTTP based API. 

## Coming Soonâ€¦.
Motion triggering to send an email via a GMail account.
